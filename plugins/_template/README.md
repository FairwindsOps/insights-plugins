# Template 

This is a template plugin. When adding a new plugin you can start with copying this directory and changing the values from there.

This section should include a description of what your plugin does.

A Dockerfile will also be required (no sample is provided). And a repository will need to be created in quay for the new plugin.

## Running locally

If there are any special instructions needed for running the plugin locally then you can add those in this section.

## Documentation

If there is any external documentation then you can link to that here.
