# Template 

This is a template plugin. When adding a new plugin you can start by copying this directory and changing the values in the included files.

This ReadMe section should include a description of what your plugin does.

Both a goreleaser configuration and a Dockerfile are required (the included sample is for a Go-based plugin), and a repository will need to be created in quay for the new plugin.

## Running locally

If there are any special instructions needed for running the plugin locally then you can add those in this section.

## Documentation

If there is any external documentation then you can link to that here.
