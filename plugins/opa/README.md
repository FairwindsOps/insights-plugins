# OPA

This is a wrapper around Open Policy Agent to allow custom checks to create action items for Fairwinds Insights.

You can add your own checks by creating either a CustomCheckInstance to utilize an existing set of rego, or a branch new CustomCheck to write your own rego.

Please let us know either here or in the `github.com/fairwindsops/charts` repo if you have ideas for additional checks that we shoudl add.
