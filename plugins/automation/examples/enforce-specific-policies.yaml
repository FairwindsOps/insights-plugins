  //--------------------------------------------
  //Enforcement Logic - Modify at your own risk!
  //--------------------------------------------

  //Step 1: Make an enforcement decision for the Admission Controller. 
  //If the Action Item matches a policy to enforce, then increase the severity to Critical.
  if (policiesToEnforce.length > 0) {
    if (policiesToEnforce.indexOf(ActionItem.EventType) !== -1) {

        //Enforce the policy specified in the policiesToEnforce object
        ActionItem.Severity = CRITICAL_SEVERITY;
    }else{

        //Since this EventType isn't in our policy to enforce list, then lower severity
        ActionItem.Severity = LOW_SEVERITY;
        ActionItem.Resolution = WORKING_AS_INTENDED_RESOLUTION;
    }
  }else{
    //Since this EventType isn't in our policy to enforce list, then lower severity
    ActionItem.Severity = LOW_SEVERITY;
    ActionItem.Resolution = WORKING_AS_INTENDED_RESOLUTION;
  }

  //Step 2: Deterine if the deployment should bypass the  Admission Controller.
  //Admission Controller will grant an exception if a YAML annotation like this exists: insights.fairwinds.com/ignore: "memoryRequestsMissing"
  policyException = ActionItem.ResourceAnnotations["insights.fairwinds.com/ignore"];

        //Reduce severity and resolve this ActionItem so it can bypass the Admission Controller
        ActionItem.Severity = LOW_SEVERITY;
        ActionItem.Resolution = WORKING_AS_INTENDED_RESOLUTION;
