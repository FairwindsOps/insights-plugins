  //--------------------------------------------

  //Step 1: Make an enforcement decision for the Admission Controller. 

  //If the Action Item matches a policy to enforce, then increase the severity to Critical.

  //Step 2: Deterine if the deployment should bypass the Admission Controller.

  //Check if the Action Item's namespace is within the exemptNamespaces array
